# Fixes Applied - House Rent Kenya

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Authentication Protection for Listings
**Problem**: Anyone could post listings without registration.

**Solution**: 
- Added authentication checks to `/admin/properties/new` page
- Users are now redirected to login if not authenticated
- Redirect parameter preserves the intended destination

### 2. My Listings Not Reflecting
**Problem**: Listings page showed mock data instead of user's actual listings.

**Solution**:
- Updated `PropertyForm` to save listings to Supabase
- Modified `/admin/properties` page to fetch user-specific listings from Supabase
- Added empty state when no listings exist
- Properties are now associated with the logged-in user's UID

### 3. Search Page Showing 0 Listings
**Problem**: "To Rent" page wasn't filtering properties correctly.

**Solution**:
- Updated search page to fetch from Supabase instead of mock data
- Added proper filtering by `type` parameter (rent/buy)
- Fixed status mapping: `type=rent` ‚Üí `status='For Rent'`, `type=buy` ‚Üí `status='For Sale'`
- Dynamic page title based on search type

### 4. Profile Picture Not Changeable
**Problem**: Profile picture was a static placeholder.

**Solution**:
- Created complete profile page with photo upload functionality
- Added camera button overlay on avatar for easy photo changes
- Integrated Supabase Storage for image uploads
- Profile photos are stored in `user-uploads/avatars/` bucket
- Photos are immediately reflected in header and admin layout

### 5. Sign In Button Still Showing After Login
**Problem**: Header showed "Sign In" button even when user was logged in.

**Solution**:
- Fixed header authentication state management
- Properly checks `user` object from Supabase auth
- Shows user avatar and dropdown menu when authenticated
- Removed anonymous user logic that was causing confusion

### 6. Dashboard Disappearing on Home Page
**Problem**: Navigation to home page lost authentication state.

**Solution**:
- Ensured consistent auth state across all pages
- Header component properly maintains user session
- Auth context persists across page navigation
- User data is fetched from Supabase session on every page load

## Database Setup Required

### Step 1: Run Supabase Schema
Execute the updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` file in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- The schema creates:
-- 1. properties table with correct column names (camelCase)
-- 2. Row Level Security policies
-- 3. Public read access for all properties
-- 4. User-specific write access for their own properties
```

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket
In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage:

1. Create a new bucket named `user-uploads`
2. Make it **public**
3. Set policies:
   - **SELECT**: Allow public access
   - **INSERT**: Allow authenticated users only
   - **UPDATE**: Allow users to update their own files
   - **DELETE**: Allow users to delete their own files

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file has:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
