# âœ… Latest Fixes - Real Data Integration

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Property Detail Page Empty
**Problem**: Property page showed nothing when clicked
**Solution**: Updated to fetch from Supabase instead of mock JSON
**File**: `src/app/property/[id]/page.tsx`

### 2. âœ… Dashboard Showing Fake Data
**Problem**: Dashboard displayed mock data for all agents
**Solution**: Now fetches only logged-in agent's properties from Supabase
**File**: `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`

### 3. âœ… Images Not Saving to Supabase
**Problem**: Images weren't uploaded to storage
**Solution**: Added Supabase Storage upload in property form
**File**: `src/app/admin/properties/components/property-form.tsx`

### 4. âœ… Images Not Displaying
**Problem**: Frontend showed placeholder images
**Solution**: Updated all pages to display real image URLs from Supabase
**Files**: Property detail, dashboard, search pages

### 5. âœ… Promotion Without Admin Approval
**Problem**: Featured flag could be set without payment
**Solution**: 
- Featured always false on creation
- Created dedicated promote page
- Requires payment screenshot upload
- Admin must approve before activation
**Files**: 
- `src/app/admin/properties/promote/[id]/page.tsx` (NEW)
- Updated property form

### 6. âœ… Promote Existing Properties
**Problem**: Could only promote during creation
**Solution**: Added "Promote Property" action in My Listings
**File**: `src/app/admin/properties/components/client-page.tsx`

### 7. âœ… Limited Property Actions
**Problem**: Only had Edit and View options
**Solution**: Added comprehensive actions:
- View Property
- Edit Property
- Promote Property
- Duplicate Property (coming soon)
- Copy Property ID
- Delete Property (with confirmation)
**File**: `src/app/admin/properties/components/client-page.tsx`
